Descritption:
--------------------
Using MTBA data to map and show if changes to bus infrastruture has had a tangable effect on commute times within the city.
Ideally mapping the failure points of the bus and train infrastruture in Boston to see if any areas are uniqually under serviced or subject to extra difficulties traveling.
Once these disperities are found graph the types of people that are being affected and possibly offer areas of change that might help to achieve more equitable travel.


Goal:
--------------------
Visualizing what groups are being affected by disperities in access to public transit. 

!!!!!!
Ideally want to take what changes have been made to the transit in Boston and compare that to the impact those changes have had. This should be able to provide some form of data that can be used to help visualize or propose new lines or areas that can be improved with the most impact. I want to see the correlations between fixes that have been provided and the efficacy of those fixes. This may lead to some pie in the sky proposal of a new line that aims to alleviate pressure on other bus or train lines but we will see where the data takes us.
!!!!!!


Offer possible recomendations and create maps (ArcGIS) of the affected areas to help convey that data.
Offer maps of what possible changes to the current system could look like. For example if we were able to achieve better access to an area how would that change how equitable living in boston is.
Are there any routes or changes that, through assumptions taken in modeling our data, would improve the traveling experience of Bostonians.

Data:
--------------------
MBTA transit data, which they offer lots of broken down by time and transit type. (https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/)
- Who and how many buses and trains are being taken. Are those areas being reached on time and what is causing those problems if they do arise. 
Boston city metrics by neighborhood (https://data.boston.gov/dataset/neighborhood-demographics) 
- To see who is being impacted by the above delays.

Might also need to access weather data or repair info to see make sure there isn't unreasonable data being used.

Modeling:
--------------------
Currently imagine using ArcGIS to make maps of the data, but open to ideas or.


Visualizing:
--------------------
As above ^

Testing:
--------------------
Compare travel data from the past (perhaps pre covid) to  current data to see if changes being made are gaving impacts that we can see in the real world and then recommend possible changes.
